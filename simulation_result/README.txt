INFORMATION REGARDING THE VARIABLES IN THE .MAT FILE

BO_val - metabolite maps

accl_factor - RAPID-SI acceleration factors

SNR - simulated SNR values


"met_name"_expected - Expected metabolite amplitude  ("met_name" can be NAA, Cho, Cr, Lac,mI) (5x7 matrix with equal values everywhere to compare with estimated values with changing SNR and BO inhomogeneity conditions.)


"met_name"_val_accl_2 - Estimated metabolite amplitude mean for accl. factor 2 (5x7 matrix with rows as decreasing SNR values and columns as increasing BO inhomogeneity)


"met_name"_val_accl_4 - Estimated metabolite amplitude mean for accl. factor 4 (5x7 matrix with rows as decreasing SNR values and columns as increasing BO inhomogeneity)


"met_name"_val_accl_8 - Estimated metabolite amplitude mean for accl. factor 8 (5x7 matrix with rows as decreasing SNR values and columns as increasing BO inhomogeneity)


"met_name"_val_accl_16 - Estimated metabolite amplitude mean for accl. factor 16 (5x7 matrix with rows as decreasing SNR values and columns as increasing BO inhomogeneity)



"met_name"_err_accl_2 - Estimated metabolite amplitude std.deviation for accl. factor 2 (5x7 matrix with rows as decreasing SNR values and columns as increasing BO inhomogeneity)


"met_name"_err_accl_4 - Estimated metabolite amplitude std.deviation for accl. factor 4 (5x7 matrix with rows as decreasing SNR values and columns as increasing BO inhomogeneity)


"met_name"_err_accl_8 - Estimated metabolite amplitude std.deviation for accl. factor 8 (5x7 matrix with rows as decreasing SNR values and columns as increasing BO inhomogeneity)


"met_name"_err_accl_16 - Estimated metabolite amplitude std.deviation for accl. factor 16 (5x7 matrix with rows as decreasing SNR values and columns as increasing BO inhomogeneity)
